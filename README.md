The Artifact Management System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the management, auctioning, and collection of artifacts. It allows artists to showcase their work, users to explore and bid on artifacts, and administrators to oversee the entire system.

## Features
* User Roles: The system supports different user roles, including Admin, Regular User (Bidder), and Artist. Each role has specific permissions and access levels.

* Artifact Management: Artists can create, edit, and manage their artifacts, providing descriptions and setting auction details.

* Auction System: Artifacts are listed in auctions with start and end times. Users can place bids on artifacts during active auctions.

* Bidding and Winning: Users can place bids on artifacts, and the highest bidder wins the artifact when the auction ends.

* Categories: Artifacts are categorized based on themes or types for easy browsing.

* User Authentication: Secure user registration and login system with password hashing.
